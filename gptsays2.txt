Option A — Use Overpass API (quickest)

Query Baden-Württemberg for parking-tagged ways:

[out:json][timeout:180];
(
  way["parking"](area:3600061477);
  way["parking:lane"](area:3600061477);
  way["parking:condition"](area:3600061477);
  way["street_parking"](area:3600061477);
  way["parking:left"](area:3600061477);
  way["parking:right"](area:3600061477);
  way["parking:both"](area:3600061477);
);
out geom;


You will receive all street segments where parking exists.

Option B — Parse the .pbf file directly (local, no Overpass limits)

Use Python + pyrosm or osmium:

Example with pyrosm:
from pyrosm import OSM
import pandas as pd

osm = OSM("baden-wuerttemberg-latest.osm.pbf")
roads = osm.get_data_by_custom_criteria(
    custom_filter={
        "parking": True,
        "parking:lane": True,
        "parking:left": True,
        "parking:right": True,
        "parking:both": True,
        "street_parking": True
    },
    filter_type="keep",
    keep_nodes=True,
    keep_ways=True,
    keep_relations=False
)

roads = roads.to_crs(4326)
print(roads.head())


This gives you all street parking-annotated ways, including tags and geometry.

✔️ Step 2 — Convert segments into parking points

OSM gives parking on street segments, not per space.
So you generate points along them:

import shapely.geometry as geom
parking_points = []

for _, row in roads.iterrows():
    line = row.geometry
    length_m = line.length * 100000  # approx
    steps = max(1, int(length_m / 10))  # point every 10 m
    for i in range(steps+1):
        pt = line.interpolate(i/steps, normalized=True)
        parking_points.append((pt.y, pt.x))  # lat, lon


Now you have usable parking locations, not in OSRM but from raw OSM.

✔️ Step 3 — Combine parking data WITH OSRM routing

Use OSRM only for:

driving distances between parking points

ETA calculations

route reconstruction

Example OSRM call:

/route/v1/driving/{lon},{lat};{lon},{lat}

🔧 If you want to integrate it into your current OSRM setup:
You CANNOT get parking from OSRM

but you CAN:

Host OSRM (you already have this)

Extract parking from the same .pbf file using osmium, pyrosm, or Overpass

Store parking candidates in PostGIS / GeoJSON / local DB

Query OSRM for routing between chosen parking points
