Challenge “Routeplanning & Logistics”
Problem:
• Many small and medium businesses still plan their routes manually
(Excel, phone, paper).
• Often one person is responsible for all planning under high time
pressure.
• New orders, changes, depots and parking locations must be constantly
updated.
• This makes planning slow, error-prone and stressful.
Imagine planning an entire city’s delivery network.
At Hack the Route, you’ll take control of urban logistics and lead it into the AI era.
Opportunity:
• Use GenAI, smart interfaces and KI-workflows to support
• Build a very lean, but flexible planning process that can be reused
across many SMEs.
• Turn route planning from a bottleneck into a smart, assistive workflow.
Your Mission:
• Design a minimal core workflow for daily tour
planning in SMEs.
• Build an intuitive interface for a single planner
to
• enter/import new orders,
• manage depots, intermediate stops
and parking locations
• Focus on:
• Simple but Flexible process
• Interactive and Smart interface
• Intregration of GenAI, AI-Workflow, AI-
Agents
Using existing open-source route optimisation is optional bonus, not
the main task.
Your Impact:
• The planner can create daily routes faster
and with less stress.
• SMEs get a practical, adaptable blueprint
for smart route planning.
• Low entry barrier: can be used even by
companies with very limited IT resources.
• You help bring real KI-support into
everyday operations of small businesses
not as a buzzword, but as a working tool
